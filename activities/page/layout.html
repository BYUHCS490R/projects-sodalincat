                Sea turtles, or marine turtles, are reptiles that live in the ocean. There are seven types of them: flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kempâ€™s ridley, and olive ridley.Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture known as bycatch in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Three species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with two of those being critically endangered.

                Sea turtles are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems. They help maintain the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs that benefit commercially valuable species such as shrimp, lobster, and tuna. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that have existed on Earth and traveled our seas for the last 100 million years. Turtles have major cultural significance and tourism value. Five of the seven species are found around the world, mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. The remaining two species, though, have relatively restricted ranges: Kemp's ridley is found mainly off the coasts of Texas and eastern Mexico, and along the eastern US seaboard, while the flatback turtle is located around northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea.
