    <p> Root is the main top level folder where all others file and folder start. </p>
    <p> The path shows where a file is located. It include folder name that lead to the file.</p>
    <p> Absolute link is full web address while relative link is just show the file location inside the project. We use relative link because it can work even if we move it to another server. </p>
