    <h1> Aloha my name is Sodalin </h1>
    <p> I was born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I am studying in BYUH, majoring in IT. Its a quite challenging for me to study in tech but I belive hard work paid off one day. I also enjoy studying in CS, I felt good when I solve the problem succesfully.</p>
    <p> My favorite quotes from <h2>President Russell M. Nelson:</h2> 
            “The Lord loves effort, because <strong>effort</strong> brings rewards that can’t come without it.”
