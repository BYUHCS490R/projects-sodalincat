    <p>
      Princess Diana is my hero. She was kind, caring, and always helped people in need. 
      Many remember her for her love, service, and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was called the <span>People’s Princess</span> because she connected with ordinary people, 
      supported AIDS awareness, and helped landmine victims.
